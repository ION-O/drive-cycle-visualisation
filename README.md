# Real-World Representative Load Profiles from Field Data
This repository provides an intuitive web-based user interface for the creation and visualisation of synthetic load profiles derived from real-world time-series data. These representative synthetic load profiles provide the ability for real-world representative forward modelling, with a direct export of PyBaMM-ready experiment text. The load profiles can also be easily converted to laboratory-based experiment through CSV export. The web-based interface provides a user-friendly methodology to achieve representative profiles from field data at varying levels of complexity with built-in visualisations for high-level user statistics. 

# Usage Guidelines
The tool presented in this work is built using Streamlit, a tool that generates user-friendly, intuitive interfaces from Python code. The following steps can be followed to run the code locally:

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

   cd drive-cycle-visualisation
   pip install .

2. Replace the file_path in data_analysis.py
   
4. Run the app
   ```bash
    streamlit run Home.py
    ```
